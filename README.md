# Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing **Sentiment Analysis** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to classify the sentiment of textual data as **positive, negative, or neutral**, leveraging various text processing techniques.

## Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates the following:
- Data preprocessing for sentiment analysis (cleaning, tokenization, etc.).
- Implementation of machine learning models for sentiment classification.
- Use of evaluation metrics to measure model performance.
- Visualizations to better understand model predictions and data.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Built using machine learning classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine).
- **Polarity Detection**: Classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
